# world-clock

   In this century, the growth of technology is at its another level and the world is working round the clock and coordinating with other countries' time zone to do great team work. So, when someone says that he or she will contact on this time according to his or her time zone, that time it is very difficult to calculate time for other person who is in different time zone. The solution of this inconvenience is “The World-Clock” application. World - clock is an application which is useful to check current time for selected time zone. There is another important functionality of time-convertor which converts future or past time and date in other time zone. For this project, we get to know how many time zones are in the world and what is the time offset of those time zones with UTC time. We have calculated time using offset of selected time zone from UTC. For output, we have used 24-hour base format for time and mm/dd/yyyy format for date. During this project, we have learned a lot about libraries we used, function of racket, GitHub and experienced team work.

### Analysis
We have mostly used functions and techniques which we have learnt in class to bear on the project. 

- Data abstraction: For checking Time Zone's offset time from UTC time.

- Recursion: We have used Recursion techniqe to do match base on 24 hour, 60 minute and 30/31/28/29 days. This making list functions have been used to convert time from one time zone into another time zone.
  
- map/filter/reduce: We have used this method to check timezone id and to seprate timezone data like country name and city name from list.
  
- functional approaches: (utc-seconds->tzoffset tzid seconds) returns the offset in second from UTC in effect at that moment of time in the given time zone. We have used functional approach to convert offset from second to minute to hours to days to month to year, so we can easily do adding and substraction.  

- state-modification approaches and lazy evaluation approaches: We have not used these two methods. 
 
### Libraries
Racket Libraries that we used include:
1. racket/gui/base
2. tzinfo
3. racket/date


### External Technologies
Accorsing to documentation on rackey/tzinfo library, UNIX systems usually come with a compiled version of the IANA database (typically in /usr/share/zoneinfo). tzinfo will use the system’s database if available. However, if the tzdata package is installed, that will be used instead. Since Windows systems do not come with a zoneinfo database, Windows users must install tzdata to use tzinfo. So, we had to install tzdata (which is available on GitHub publicly) to use tzinfo.

### Data Sets or other Source Materials
We have not used other source materials in project. But we have used time zone data from other website as a research work and for test purpose. 

### Deliverable and Demonstration
We developed a program which prompt the user to select time zone to see current time. User can also check the time in different time zone by selecting any date and time.  

### Evaluation of Results
Successful implementation is defined as having:
1. Ability to select country and city from the list to see current time. 
2. convert time by selecting date, time and different time zones

This diagram includes implementation/design, evaluation and testing parts.
   
   We had collected enough information about time zones. So our next step for the project implementation was to use those information. After this research, Vibhuti developed graphical user interface using recket/gui library. And Prachi worked with racket/tzinfo library. She wrote some basic functions to display current time for selected time zone. Then we worked on procedures to convert time from one time zone to another. To converting process, we are calculating the offset of time-zone from UTC. Then we figure out the actual time difference between two time zones in application algorithm. User get output for time in 24-hour base format and date in mm/dd/yyyy format. Forth step was evaluation and testing. We have done enough testing and compared output with expected result. 



## Schedule

### First Milestone (Sun Apr 9)
By the first milestone, we have done two parts. First part was user interface and second was time convertor functionality. The plan was to have time zone converter working for different locations with respective time zone. User can also check the current time by selecting country/city from drop down menu.

### Second Milestone (Sun Apr 16)
To converting time from one time zone to another was challenging and hard to implement logic. The actual time went to develop algorithm for adding and substracting offset time from given input time.
We evaluated the requirements of the project and then done enough testing for the application. 

### Public Presentation (Wed Apr 26)
we have working “World Clock” application.

## Group Responsibilities

### Prachi Patel @prachiipatel
I worked on the implementation of the application, using two libraries ‘tzinfo’ and ‘racket/date’. The tzinfo library provides an interface for querying the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority time zone database. It is helpful when the selected time zone ID falls into a gap between offset, when daylight saving time starts or ends. So, the user will be able to find the time on different locations with respective time zone. 

### Vibhuti Patel @vibhutipatel18 
I am team leader. I have worked on designing and coding part of graphical user interface. Once structure was ready, I was
adding events and functionality in GUI components like button, input boxes, labels etc. After that, I have helped to write code for converting time functionality and displaying output. Because of this project, I got to work on scheme enviroment and to explor GUI library in racket. I most enjoyed to writing algorithm for the mathematics calculation on time inputs.
